# Client Data Management System - Project Plan

## Executive Summary

This project converts an Excel + PowerBI-based client data management system into a modern Next.js web application with optional Electron desktop deployment. The system manages IT infrastructure data for multiple clients, including workstations, servers, users, credentials, and contact information.

### Current State
- Technicians enter data into Excel files stored on network drive (S:\PBIData\NetDoc\Manual)
- PowerBI dashboard provides read-only data visualization
- Semi-normalized data across 10+ Excel files
- Client relationships tracked via abbreviation codes (e.g., "BT" for Biztech)

### Target State
- Next.js web application with authentication
- Read and write access to Excel files (maintaining Excel as data store)
- Responsive UI with tables and filters
- Support for both web deployment and Electron desktop app

## Phase 1: PowerBI Frontend Replacement

### Objective
Create a read-only dashboard to replace PowerBI, displaying the 4 most important data views.

### Priority Data Views (to be confirmed with stakeholder)
Based on data structure, recommended initial views:
1. **Infrastructure Dashboard** (many .xlsx files)
   - Filterable by Client
   - four tables (External Data, Core data, a fusion of worstation and users data, and notes for managed WAN info.)
   - a section for the administration email and password
   - a section for the administration phone (mitel) name and password
   - a section for the administration acronis name and password
   - a section for the administration cloudflare name and password.
2. **Infrastructure Dashboard** (Core.xlsx)
   - Filterable by Client, SubName, Grouping
   - Key fields: Name, IP address, Login, Description
   - Show "On Landing Page" items prominently

3. **Workstations Overview** (Workstations.xlsx)
   - Filterable by Client, Active status
   - Key fields: Computer Name, IP Address, Service Tag, Description

4. **User Accounts** (Users.xlsx)
   - Filterable by Client, Active status
   - Key fields: Name, Login, Computer Name, Phone

## Migration Path from Excel to Database (Phase 3+)

If transitioning away from Excel files:

1. **Database Schema Design**
   - Normalize data model
   - Define relationships and constraints
   - Plan migration scripts

2. **Dual-Write Period**
   - Write to both Excel and database
   - Validate data consistency
   - Monitor performance

3. **Cutover**
   - Switch to database as primary
   - Keep Excel as backup
   - Migrate historical data

4. **Benefits**
   - Better concurrent access
   - ACID transactions
   - Complex queries
   - Data integrity constraints
   - Better performance at scale

---

## Key Decisions & Questions

### To Be Decided
1. **Which 4 views are priority for Phase 1?**
   - Current recommendation: Infrastructure, Workstations, Users, Clients
   - Confirm with stakeholders

2. **Authentication source?**
   - Local user database (recommended)
   - Active Directory integration
   - Single Sign-On (SSO)

3. **Deployment preference?**
   - Web-first, Electron later
   - Both simultaneously
   - Electron-only

4. **File locking strategy?**
   - Advisory locks (warning only)
   - Mandatory locks (prevent concurrent writes)
   - Last-write-wins with conflict detection

5. **Data refresh frequency?**
   - Real-time (read on every request)
   - Cached with TTL (5-10 minutes)
   - Manual refresh button

### Assumptions
- Network drive (S:\) is accessible from web server
- Excel files follow consistent schema
- Client abbreviations are unique and stable
- Concurrent write operations are rare
- Users have Windows authentication to network

---

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1
- [ ] All 4 priority views displaying correct data
- [ ] Page load time < 3 seconds
- [ ] Support for 10+ concurrent users
- [ ] 99%+ data accuracy vs. PowerBI
- [ ] User satisfaction > 4/5

### Phase 2
- [ ] Data entry time reduced by 50%
- [ ] Zero data corruption incidents
- [ ] < 1% data entry errors
- [ ] All technicians trained and using system
- [ ] Complete audit trail for 100% of changes

---

## Risk Management

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Network file access issues | High | Medium | Implement robust error handling, fallback mechanisms, local caching |
| Concurrent write conflicts | Medium | Low | File locking, conflict detection, audit trail |
| Data corruption | High | Low | Backup before write, validation, rollback capability |
| User adoption resistance | Medium | Medium | Training, gradual rollout, familiar UI design |
| Performance with large files | Medium | Medium | Caching strategy, pagination, lazy loading |
| Security breach | High | Low | Authentication, encryption, audit logging, regular updates |

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-12
**Next Review:** After Phase 1 completion


**Misc work:**

SQLite Schema:


CREATE TABLE misc_documents (
  client TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  file_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  file_data BLOB NOT NULL,
  last_updated TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
This will store the entire Excel file as a BLOB, allowing you to:

Retrieve and download the original file
Display it in a viewer/editor later
Keep the original structure intact
Migration Script: (scripts/migrate-misc.ts)

Scan the Examples/Misc/ folder for .xlsx files
Read each file as binary
Insert into SQLite with client abbreviation (from filename)
Delete the Misc folder after successful migration
API Endpoint: (/api/data/misc?client=BT)

Returns the BLOB as a downloadable file
Or returns metadata about the misc document
Next Steps:

Please add the Examples/Misc/ folder with a couple example client files (e.g., BT.xlsx, AE.xlsx), and I'll:

Examine their structure to understand what we're storing
Build the migration script
Create the API endpoint
Update the dashboard to show/download these files
Once you've added the folder, let me know and I'll get started!
